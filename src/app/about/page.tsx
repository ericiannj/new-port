      At the time, a notable case was a complex project we carried out, which
      aimed to build a new architecture and restructure an application to enable
      the implementation of new methods, services, libraries, and components
      (including updating frameworks). His work was fundamental to the success
      of the project, which he was able to apply and develop in Front-end,
      Back-end, and DevOps concepts.&quot;

      During the time I worked with him, I learned a lot and we evolved as
